# Signup Component - Defect Density Analysis

## Overview

This folder contains the defect density analysis for the signup component of the Mirror application. Defect density is a software quality metric that measures the number of confirmed defects per thousand lines of code (KLOC).

## Contents

1. **defect-density-analysis.md** - The comprehensive defect density calculation and analysis
2. **code-summary.md** - Summary of the code files included in this analysis
3. **defect-details.md** - Detailed information about each identified defect

## Key Findings

- **Component Size**: 206 lines of code (0.206 KLOC)
- **Number of Defects**: 4 defects identified
- **Defect Density**: 19.42 defects per KLOC
- **Severity Breakdown**:
  - Major: 2
  - Minor: 2

## Methodology

The defect density analysis was conducted using the following methodology:

1. **Code Identification**: Identifying all files that make up the signup component
2. **LOC Counting**: Counting lines of code in each file
3. **Defect Identification**: Review of bug reports, security testing documentation, and code reviews
4. **Density Calculation**: Applying the formula: Defects / KLOC
5. **Analysis**: Interpretation of results and recommendations

## Conclusion

The signup component has a relatively high defect density, primarily related to security and input validation issues. Addressing these defects, especially the security-related ones, should be prioritized to improve the quality and reliability of the signup process.
