# Signup Component - Defect Details

## Defect Tracking

This document provides detailed information about the defects identified in the signup component of the Mirror application.

### DEF-001: Weak Password Requirements

**Summary**: Password requirements (minimum 6 characters) are insufficient according to security standards

**Description**:  
The current password validation only requires passwords to be at least 6 characters long, which does not meet modern security standards. While there is client-side validation requiring uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters, the server-side validation only checks for length, creating a security gap if client-side validation is bypassed.

**Severity**: Major

**Steps to Reproduce**:
1. Disable JavaScript in the browser or use a tool like Postman
2. Send a direct request to the signup API endpoint with a simple password (e.g., "123456")
3. Observe that the request is successful despite not meeting complexity requirements

**Expected Result**:  
The server should validate that the password meets all security requirements, including complexity rules.

**Actual Result**:  
The server only checks password length (6 characters) and creates the user account.

**Impact**:
This vulnerability could lead to weak user passwords in the system, making accounts susceptible to brute force attacks.

**Status**: Fixed

**Fix Implementation**:
- Added server-side password complexity validation
- Increased minimum password length to 8 characters
- Implemented consistent validation between client and server

### DEF-002: Missing Protection Against Brute Force

**Summary**: No rate limiting on registration endpoint

**Description**:  
The signup endpoint does not implement any form of rate limiting, allowing an attacker to make unlimited registration attempts. This could be exploited for user enumeration (determining which email addresses are already registered) or to create many fake accounts in a short period.

**Severity**: Major

**Steps to Reproduce**:
1. Use an automated tool to send multiple signup requests in rapid succession
2. Observe that all requests are processed without any rate limiting or temporary blocks

**Expected Result**:  
The system should limit the number of registration attempts from the same IP address within a specific timeframe.

**Actual Result**:  
No limit is applied, allowing unlimited registration attempts.

**Impact**:
This vulnerability could be exploited for:
- User enumeration attacks
- Creation of numerous spam accounts
- Denial of service by overloading the registration system

**Status**: Open

**Proposed Fix**:
- Implement IP-based rate limiting on the signup endpoint
- Add CAPTCHA for registrations after a certain threshold
- Implement temporary blocks for IPs making too many failed attempts

### DEF-003: Missing Field Validation - Name Field

**Summary**: Name field allows special characters

**Description**:  
The name field in the signup form lacks proper validation, allowing any characters including potentially harmful ones like HTML tags or script injection attempts. While there is protection against XSS at the framework level, the lack of proper validation still allows unusual or unprintable characters.

**Severity**: Minor

**Steps to Reproduce**:
1. Navigate to the signup page
2. Enter special characters or HTML tags in the name field (e.g., "<script>alert(1)</script>")
3. Complete the registration process
4. Observe that the account is created with the unfiltered input

**Expected Result**:  
The system should validate the name field to ensure it contains only appropriate characters.

**Actual Result**:  
Any characters are accepted in the name field.

**Impact**:
- Potential for confusing or misleading user displays
- Edge cases in name display throughout the application
- Possibility of stored XSS if framework protection is bypassed

**Status**: Open

**Proposed Fix**:
- Add server-side validation for the name field
- Implement a whitelist approach allowing only letters, spaces, and common name characters
- Add client-side validation with clear error messages

### DEF-004: Email Validation Insufficient

**Summary**: Does not properly validate email format

**Description**:  
The current implementation uses HTML5 email input type for client-side validation, but the server-side validation only checks if the email field is present, not if it follows a valid email format. This can lead to invalid email addresses being stored in the database if client-side validation is bypassed.

**Severity**: Minor

**Steps to Reproduce**:
1. Disable JavaScript in the browser or use a tool like Postman
2. Send a direct request to the signup API endpoint with an invalid email format (e.g., "notanemail")
3. Observe that the request is successful despite the email being invalid

**Expected Result**:  
The server should validate that the email follows a proper format.

**Actual Result**:  
Any string is accepted as an email as long as the field is not empty.

**Impact**:
- Invalid emails in the database
- Potential delivery issues for system emails
- User confusion when trying to login with an improperly formatted email

**Status**: Open

**Proposed Fix**:
- Add server-side email format validation
- Implement proper regex pattern for email validation
- Add more descriptive error messages for invalid email formats

## Conclusion

The signup component contains 4 identified defects, including 2 major security issues and 2 minor input validation problems. Addressing these issues, especially the security-related ones, should be prioritized to improve the overall quality and security of the application.
