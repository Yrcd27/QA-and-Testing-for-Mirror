## Issue Tracker Implementation

For this project, we've implemented bug tracking using Jira Software Cloud. We've:

1. Created a Jira project specifically for tracking Mirror application bugs
2. Entered detailed bug reports in Jira with all required information
3. Performed root cause analysis within Jira
4. Captured screenshots of the implementation for documentation

The bug reports in Jira include:

- Bug ID (automatically generated by Jira)
- Summary
- Description
- Severity (Critical, Major, Minor)
- Steps to Reproduce
- Expected Result
- Actual Result
- Screenshots/Evidence
- Environment Details

See the [Jira Implementation Evidence](./jira-implementation-evidence.md) document for details and screenshots of the actual implementation.

## Defect Management Process

1. **Bug Discovery**: Bugs are identified during various testing phases (unit, integration, security, etc.)
2. **Bug Logging**: Detailed bug reports are created with all necessary information
3. **Bug Triage**: Bugs are evaluated and prioritized based on severity and impact
4. **Bug Assignment**: Bugs are assigned to developers for resolution
5. **Root Cause Analysis**: Selected bugs undergo detailed analysis to prevent recurrence
6. **Bug Resolution**: Fixes are implemented and verified
7. **Regression Testing**: Tests are performed to ensure the fix doesn't introduce new issues
