# Bug Submission and Tracking Process

## Overview

This document outlines the process for submitting, tracking, and resolving bugs in the Mirror application. It provides guidelines for the entire defect management lifecycle from discovery to resolution and verification.

## Bug Lifecycle

The lifecycle of a bug in our tracking system follows these states:

1. **New** - Bug is reported but not yet validated
2. **Open** - Bug is validated and awaiting assignment
3. **In Progress** - Bug is assigned and being worked on
4. **Fixed** - Developer has implemented a fix
5. **Verification** - QA is testing the fix
6. **Closed** - Bug has been verified as fixed
7. **Reopened** - Bug was thought to be fixed but reappeared
8. **Won't Fix** - Decision made not to fix the bug (with justification)

## Bug Submission Guidelines

### When to Submit a Bug

Submit a bug report when you encounter any of the following:
- The application crashes or displays an error message
- The application behaves differently than specified in requirements
- The UI displays incorrectly
- Performance does not meet requirements
- Security vulnerabilities are discovered
- Accessibility issues are identified

### Required Information

All bug reports must include:

1. **Summary** - A concise, clear description of the issue
2. **Description** - Detailed information about the bug
3. **Severity** - Impact level (Critical, Major, Minor)
4. **Steps to Reproduce** - Numbered, specific steps to recreate the issue
5. **Expected Result** - What should happen when following the steps
6. **Actual Result** - What actually happens when following the steps
7. **Environment** - Browser, OS, versions, and other relevant details
8. **Screenshots/Evidence** - Visual proof of the issue when applicable

### Severity Definitions

- **Critical**:
  - Application crash or data loss
  - Security vulnerability with high risk
  - Core functionality completely broken
  - No workaround available
  - Affects all users

- **Major**:
  - Important feature not working as expected
  - Workaround exists but is cumbersome
  - Affects a significant number of users
  - Security vulnerability with medium risk
  - Significant performance degradation

- **Minor**:
  - UI or formatting issues
  - Feature works but with minor inconveniences
  - Affects a small number of users
  - Easy workaround available
  - Typos or cosmetic issues

## Bug Triage Process

Bugs are triaged weekly by the team during the Bug Triage Meeting:

1. **Validation** - Confirm the bug exists and can be reproduced
2. **Severity Assessment** - Assign or adjust the severity level
3. **Priority Setting** - Determine when the bug should be fixed
4. **Assignment** - Allocate the bug to a developer
5. **Sprint Planning** - Schedule the bug for a specific sprint

## Root Cause Analysis (RCA)

For Critical severity bugs or recurring issues, a formal Root Cause Analysis is conducted:

1. **Problem Statement** - Clear definition of the issue
2. **Impact Assessment** - Scope and effect on users and system
3. **Investigation** - Deep dive into code, logs, and system behavior
4. **Root Cause Identification** - Determination of the fundamental cause
5. **Solution Development** - Comprehensive fix addressing the root cause
6. **Prevention Strategy** - Measures to prevent similar issues
7. **Documentation** - Recording findings for knowledge sharing

## Bug Resolution and Verification

When a developer resolves a bug:

1. **Code Review** - Another developer reviews the changes
2. **Unit Testing** - Developer writes/updates tests to cover the fix
3. **QA Verification** - QA team validates the fix works properly
4. **Regression Testing** - Ensure the fix doesn't break other functionality
5. **Documentation Update** - Update relevant documentation if needed
6. **Release Notes** - Add the bug fix to release notes

## Metrics and Reporting

The following metrics are tracked to monitor the defect management process:

1. **Defect Density** - Number of defects per feature or code size
2. **Mean Time to Resolution** - Average time from report to fix
3. **Defect Escape Rate** - Bugs found in production vs. testing
4. **Defect Distribution** - Analysis of bug types and components
5. **Fix Success Rate** - Percentage of bugs fixed correctly the first time

## Tools and Integration

Our defect tracking process is integrated with the following tools and processes:

1. **Issue Tracker** - Jira/Bugzilla for bug documentation and workflow
2. **Version Control** - Git with branch naming convention for bug fixes
3. **CI/CD Pipeline** - Automated testing of fixes
4. **Code Review** - Pull request process with required approvals
5. **Documentation** - Wiki updates for knowledge sharing

## Example Bug Report

See the [Jira-Style Bug Template](./jira-ticket-examples.md) document for examples of well-formatted bug reports following this process.
