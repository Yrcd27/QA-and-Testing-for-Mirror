# Security Testing Report: OWASP Top 10 Analysis

## Overview

This report documents a security review of the Mirror MERN application based on the OWASP Top 10 Web Application Security Risks (2021). The analysis focused on identifying and fixing at least two critical vulnerabilities from the OWASP Top 10 list.

## Testing Methodology

1. **Code Review**: Conducted a thorough review of both backend and frontend code
2. **Vulnerability Assessment**: Identified security weaknesses according to OWASP guidelines
3. **Remediation**: Implemented fixes for the identified vulnerabilities
4. **Documentation**: Created evidence of the vulnerabilities and their fixes

## Identified Vulnerabilities

### 1. A07:2021 - Identification and Authentication Failures

Authentication failures are among the most common and impactful security issues in web applications. They occur when functions related to user identity, authentication, or session management are implemented incorrectly.

#### Findings in Mirror Application:

- **Insecure JWT Implementation**: 
  - Short-lived tokens (1 hour) with no refresh mechanism
  - No proper token invalidation capability
  - Weak error handling for token validation issues

- **Weak Password Requirements**:
  - Minimal password length (6 characters)
  - No complexity requirements
  - Basic password hashing (could be strengthened)

- **Missing Protection Against Brute Force**:
  - No rate limiting on authentication endpoints
  - No account lockout mechanism
  - Same error message used for both "user not found" and "invalid password"

- **Insecure Token Storage**:
  - Tokens stored in localStorage, vulnerable to XSS attacks
  - No HTTP-only cookies for sensitive authentication data
  - No CSRF protection

### 2. A01:2021 - Broken Access Control

Broken access control remained at the top of the OWASP Top 10 list in 2021. These vulnerabilities allow attackers to bypass authorization, view sensitive data, or perform unauthorized functions.

#### Findings in Mirror Application:

- **Permissive CORS Configuration**:
  - No origin restrictions (`app.use(cors())`)
  - Any website could make cross-origin requests to the API
  - Missing security headers and proper CORS policy

- **Hardcoded API URLs**:
  - API URLs hardcoded in frontend components
  - No environment-based configuration
  - Difficult to secure in production environments

- **Insufficient Access Control**:
  - Missing rate limiting on API endpoints
  - No protection against API abuse
  - Limited error handling for security-related failures

## Implemented Security Fixes

### 1. Enhanced Authentication System

To address the authentication vulnerabilities, we implemented a comprehensive security upgrade:

- **Secure JWT Implementation**:
  - Short-lived access tokens (15 minutes) with refresh token mechanism
  - Refresh tokens stored server-side in database with one-time use policy
  - Enhanced error handling for different token validation scenarios

- **Strengthened Password Security**:
  - Increased minimum password length to 8 characters
  - Added complexity requirements (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special chars)
  - Increased bcrypt cost factor for stronger password hashing

- **Brute Force Protection**:
  - IP-based rate limiting for login attempts
  - Temporary account lockout after multiple failed attempts
  - Consistent error messages that don't leak user information

- **Secure Token Storage**:
  - HTTP-only cookies for refresh tokens
  - Proper sameSite and secure cookie attributes
  - Added CSRF protection
  - Improved token rotation and invalidation

### 2. Robust Access Control

To fix the broken access control issues:

- **Secure CORS Implementation**:
  - Whitelist-based origin restrictions
  - Proper configuration of allowed methods, headers
  - Added preflight request handling and caching

- **Centralized API Configuration**:
  - Created a centralized API client with environment-based URL configuration
  - Implemented proper error and token handling
  - Organized API calls by resource type

- **Enhanced Access Controls**:
  - Added rate limiting to prevent API abuse
  - Implemented proper error handling without leaking details
  - Added security headers with Helmet.js

## Recommendations for Additional Security Improvements

1. **Implement Content Security Policy (CSP)**
   - Add strict CSP headers to prevent XSS attacks

2. **Enable Security Logging and Monitoring**
   - Implement comprehensive security logging
   - Set up alerts for suspicious activities

3. **Regular Security Audits**
   - Conduct periodic security reviews
   - Use automated scanning tools

4. **Security Training**
   - Provide security awareness training for developers
   - Establish secure coding guidelines

5. **HTTPS Enforcement**
   - Ensure all communications are encrypted
   - Implement HSTS headers

## Conclusion

This security review identified significant vulnerabilities related to authentication and access control in the Mirror application. The implemented fixes address these issues comprehensively, enhancing the overall security posture of the application. Regular security reviews should be conducted to maintain and improve security as the application evolves.
