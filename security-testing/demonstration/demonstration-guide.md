# Security Testing Demonstration Guide

This guide will help you demonstrate the security fixes implemented in the Mirror application and capture appropriate screenshots for documentation purposes.

## Setup for Demonstration

### Prerequisites:
- Running instance of the Mirror application with security fixes implemented
- Web browser with developer tools (Chrome or Firefox recommended)
- Postman or similar API testing tool
- Browser extensions: 
  - CORS checker (e.g., "CORS Unblock" for testing purposes)
  - JWT Debugger

## Demonstration 1: Authentication Security Improvements

### Step 1: Password Strength Enforcement

**Objective:** Demonstrate that the system enforces stronger password requirements.

1. Navigate to the signup page of the application
2. Try to create an account with a weak password (e.g., "password123")
3. Observe the validation error message

**Screenshots to Take:**
- Error message showing password complexity requirements
- Title: "Password Complexity Requirements"

### Step 2: JWT and Refresh Token Implementation

**Objective:** Demonstrate the secure token implementation with refresh tokens.

1. Log in to the application with valid credentials
2. Open browser developer tools (F12)
3. Go to Application tab > Storage > Cookies
4. Observe the HTTP-only refresh token cookie
5. Go to Application tab > Storage > Local Storage
6. Observe the access token storage

**Screenshots to Take:**
- Browser cookies showing HTTP-only refresh token
- Title: "HTTP-only Refresh Token Cookie"
- Local storage showing the access token
- Title: "Access Token in Local Storage"

### Step 3: Token Refresh Mechanism

**Objective:** Demonstrate that tokens are refreshed automatically.

1. Using browser developer tools, edit the access token in localStorage to be invalid
2. Perform an action that requires authentication
3. Observe network traffic in the developer tools Network tab
4. See the token refresh request and subsequent API call with new token

**Screenshots to Take:**
- Network tab showing the refresh token request
- Title: "Token Refresh Mechanism"
- New valid access token in localStorage after refresh
- Title: "New Access Token After Refresh"

### Step 4: Rate Limiting Protection

**Objective:** Demonstrate protection against brute force attempts.

1. Open Postman or similar API testing tool
2. Configure a request to the login endpoint with incorrect credentials
3. Set up a collection runner to send the same request multiple times quickly
4. Observe the rate limit error response after several attempts

**Screenshots to Take:**
- Rate limit error response in Postman
- Title: "Rate Limiting Protection Against Brute Force"
- Headers showing rate limit information
- Title: "Rate Limit Headers"

## Demonstration 2: Access Control Improvements

### Step 1: CORS Protection

**Objective:** Demonstrate that the API is protected from unauthorized origins.

1. Open browser console in a different domain (e.g., jsfiddle.net or codepen.io)
2. Try to make a fetch request to your API endpoint
3. Observe the CORS error in the console

**Screenshots to Take:**
- Console showing CORS error for unauthorized domain
- Title: "CORS Protection Blocking Unauthorized Origin"

### Step 2: API Request with Proper Origin

**Objective:** Demonstrate that legitimate requests from allowed origins work.

1. From the application's frontend, make an authenticated API request
2. Observe the successful request in the Network tab
3. Note the CORS headers in the response

**Screenshots to Take:**
- Network tab showing successful API request with CORS headers
- Title: "Successful Request from Authorized Origin"
- Response headers showing the CORS configuration
- Title: "CORS Headers for Authorized Origin"

### Step 3: Centralized API Configuration

**Objective:** Demonstrate the centralized API configuration in action.

1. Open the browser developer tools
2. Go to the Sources tab
3. Navigate to your application code and find the apiConfig.js file
4. Set a breakpoint in one of the API request functions
5. Perform an action that triggers that API call
6. Observe how the configuration is applied

**Screenshots to Take:**
- Sources tab showing the apiConfig.js file with breakpoint
- Title: "Centralized API Configuration"
- Debugger paused showing the API request with proper configuration
- Title: "API Request Using Centralized Configuration"

### Step 4: API Rate Limiting

**Objective:** Demonstrate API rate limiting protection.

1. Using Postman, set up a collection runner for a protected API endpoint
2. Run multiple requests in quick succession
3. Observe rate limiting responses after exceeding the limit

**Screenshots to Take:**
- Postman showing rate limit error responses
- Title: "API Rate Limiting Protection"
- Response headers showing rate limit information
- Title: "API Rate Limit Headers"

## Additional Security Demonstrations (Optional)

### Secure Headers

**Objective:** Demonstrate the secure HTTP headers added by Helmet.js.

1. Make any request to the application
2. In developer tools, go to the Network tab
3. Select a response and view the headers
4. Note security headers like Content-Security-Policy, X-XSS-Protection, etc.

**Screenshots to Take:**
- Network tab showing security headers in response
- Title: "Secure HTTP Headers"

### Error Handling

**Objective:** Demonstrate proper error handling that doesn't leak sensitive information.

1. Intentionally cause an error (e.g., try to access a resource that doesn't exist)
2. Observe the error response in the Network tab
3. Note that it doesn't include stack traces or sensitive details in production mode

**Screenshots to Take:**
- Network tab showing sanitized error response
- Title: "Secure Error Handling"

## Creating a Demonstration Document

After capturing all the screenshots, create a demonstration document with the following structure:

1. **Introduction**
   - Brief overview of the security fixes
   - Testing environment details

2. **Authentication Security Demonstration**
   - Include all screenshots from the authentication section
   - Provide explanations for each screenshot
   - Highlight the security improvements

3. **Access Control Demonstration**
   - Include all screenshots from the access control section
   - Provide explanations for each screenshot
   - Highlight the security improvements

4. **Additional Security Features**
   - Include any additional security feature screenshots
   - Explain their importance

5. **Conclusion**
   - Summary of the security improvements
   - Recommendations for ongoing security practices
