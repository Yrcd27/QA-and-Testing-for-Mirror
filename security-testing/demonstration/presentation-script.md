# Security Testing Demonstration Script

This script provides a narrative guide for presenting the security improvements implemented in the Mirror application to address OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities.

## Introduction (2-3 minutes)

"Today I'll be demonstrating the security improvements we've implemented to address critical OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities in our Mirror application. Specifically, we've focused on two major areas:

1. Identification and Authentication Failures (A07:2021)
2. Broken Access Control (A01:2021)

These vulnerabilities represent some of the most common and serious security risks in web applications. The improvements we've made significantly enhance our application's security posture."

## Authentication Security Demonstration (7-10 minutes)

### Password Strength Requirements

"First, let's look at our enhanced password requirements. Previously, we only required passwords to be 6 characters long with no complexity requirements."

**Action**: Navigate to signup page and attempt to create an account with a weak password.

"As you can see, the system now enforces stronger password requirements, including minimum 8 characters, uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters. This significantly reduces the risk of password-based attacks."

### JWT Implementation with Refresh Tokens

"Next, let's examine our improved authentication token system. Previously, we used a simple JWT token stored in localStorage with a 1-hour expiration and no refresh mechanism."

**Action**: Log in to the application and open developer tools to show cookies and localStorage.

"Our new implementation uses a dual-token approach:
1. A short-lived access token (15 minutes) stored in localStorage for API authentication
2. A longer-lived refresh token (7 days) stored as an HTTP-only cookie

Notice how the refresh token is marked as HTTP-only, which means it can't be accessed by JavaScript. This protects it from XSS attacks. The access token is short-lived to minimize the window of opportunity for token theft."

### Token Refresh Mechanism

"Let's see how the token refresh mechanism works when an access token expires."

**Action**: Modify the access token to be invalid, then perform an authenticated action.

"As you can see in the network tab, when the system detects an invalid access token, it automatically:
1. Attempts to refresh using the secure refresh token
2. Obtains a new access token
3. Retries the original request

This provides a seamless user experience while maintaining strong security. Also notice that refresh tokens are one-time use only - each refresh generates a new refresh token, protecting against token replay attacks."

### Rate Limiting Protection

"Now, let's examine our protection against brute force attacks."

**Action**: Use Postman to demonstrate multiple failed login attempts.

"After several failed login attempts, the system now implements rate limiting to prevent brute force password guessing. Notice the response headers indicating rate limit information and the error message received after exceeding the limit."

## Access Control Demonstration (7-10 minutes)

### CORS Protection

"Let's look at our improved CORS protection. Previously, our application used a basic CORS setup that allowed requests from any origin."

**Action**: Show attempt to access API from an unauthorized origin.

"Our enhanced CORS configuration now implements a whitelist-based approach, only allowing requests from specific authorized origins. This prevents unauthorized websites from making requests to our API and accessing user data."

### Centralized API Configuration

"Another important improvement is our centralized API configuration."

**Action**: Show the apiConfig.js file and demonstrate an API request.

"Previously, our application had hardcoded API URLs scattered throughout the frontend components. Now, all API calls go through a centralized configuration that:
1. Gets the base URL from environment variables
2. Handles authentication tokens automatically
3. Implements refresh token logic
4. Provides organized API functions by resource type

This ensures consistent security across all API calls and makes environment-specific configuration much easier."

### API Rate Limiting

"We've also implemented rate limiting across all API endpoints."

**Action**: Demonstrate multiple rapid API requests in Postman.

"This protection prevents API abuse by limiting the number of requests from a single source within a time window. Notice the different rate limits for general API endpoints versus more sensitive endpoints like authentication."

### Secure HTTP Headers

"Let's examine the additional security headers we've implemented."

**Action**: Make a request and show response headers.

"Using Helmet.js, we've added several security headers to protect against common web vulnerabilities:
1. Content-Security-Policy: Controls what resources the browser is allowed to load
2. X-XSS-Protection: Helps prevent cross-site scripting attacks
3. X-Frame-Options: Prevents clickjacking by controlling iframe usage
4. And several others that enhance our security posture"

## Conclusion (2-3 minutes)

"To summarize, we've implemented comprehensive security improvements addressing two critical OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities:

1. For Authentication Security:
   - Enhanced password requirements
   - Secure token implementation with refresh mechanism
   - Protection against brute force attacks
   - Secure token storage

2. For Access Control:
   - Proper CORS configuration
   - Centralized API management
   - Rate limiting protection
   - Secure HTTP headers

These improvements significantly enhance the security of our Mirror application. Going forward, we recommend:
1. Regular security testing and code reviews
2. Keeping dependencies updated
3. Implementing the additional security measures outlined in our documentation

Thank you for your attention. Are there any questions about the security improvements I've demonstrated?"

## Tips for Delivery

1. **Practice the Demonstration**: Ensure everything works smoothly before presenting.

2. **Prepare Your Environment**: Have all necessary tools and windows ready.

3. **Explain Technical Concepts Simply**: Not everyone may understand JWT tokens or CORS - explain concepts briefly.

4. **Highlight Business Impact**: Mention how these security improvements protect user data and business reputation.

5. **Be Ready for Questions**: Anticipate questions about implementation details, effort required, or other security concerns.

6. **Have Fallbacks Ready**: If a live demonstration fails, have screenshots prepared as backup.
