# Security Testing Results

## Overview

This project implemented a comprehensive security review of the Mirror application based on the OWASP Top 10 Web Application Security Risks (2021). The security testing focused on identifying and fixing critical vulnerabilities.

## Vulnerabilities Identified and Fixed

### 1. A07:2021 - Identification and Authentication Failures

**Original Issues**:
- Basic JWT implementation with short-lived tokens (1 hour)
- No refresh token mechanism
- Weak password requirements (only 6 characters)
- No protection against brute force attacks
- Insecure token storage in localStorage

**Implemented Fixes**:
- Enhanced JWT implementation with short-lived access tokens (15 minutes) and refresh tokens
- Implemented secure token storage with HTTP-only cookies
- Added rate limiting for authentication endpoints
- Strengthened password requirements (8+ characters with complexity)
- Added comprehensive error handling for token validation

### 2. A01:2021 - Broken Access Control

**Original Issues**:
- Permissive CORS configuration allowing any origin
- Hardcoded API URLs throughout the frontend
- No rate limiting to protect against API abuse
- Insufficient error handling for security-related failures

**Implemented Fixes**:
- Implemented whitelist-based CORS policy
- Created centralized API configuration with proper environment variables
- Added rate limiting for all API endpoints
- Enhanced error handling without leaking sensitive information
- Added security headers with Helmet.js

## Implementation Files

The security fixes have been implemented in the following files:

1. **Authentication Security**:
   - `fixes/authMiddleware.js`: Enhanced authentication middleware with proper token validation
   - `fixes/RefreshToken.js`: Model for secure refresh token storage
   - `fixes/authRoutes.js`: Improved authentication routes with refresh token mechanism

2. **Access Control Security**:
   - `fixes/server.js`: Secure server configuration with proper CORS and rate limiting
   - `fixes/apiConfig.js`: Centralized API configuration for the frontend
   - `fixes/.env.example` and `fixes/.env.frontend.example`: Secure environment configuration

2. **CORS & Access Control Fix**: Detailed before/after code snippets showing the access control improvements

## Next Steps

1. Implement the fixes in the actual codebase following the implementation guide
2. Conduct regular security reviews and testing
3. Consider implementing additional security measures from the recommendations section of the report
